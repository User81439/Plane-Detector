# Troubleshooting #
###################
error: (-215:Assertion failed) !_img.empty() in function 'imwrite' python
    the above error is caused by the .ts file link becoming invalid, due to the program taking to long to run through
    and take the image
    SOLUTION: reduce lines of code and statements being run through to ensure the link stays valid while a image is taken
